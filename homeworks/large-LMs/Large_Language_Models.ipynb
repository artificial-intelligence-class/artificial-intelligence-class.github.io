        " * `model` â€“Â OpenAI offers four different sized versionf of the GPT-3 model: davinci, currie, babbage and ada.  Davinci has the largest number of parameters and is [the most expensive to run](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).  Ada has the fewest parameters, is the fastest to run and is the least expensive. \n",
        " * `prompt` - this is the prompt that the model will generate a completion for\n",
        " * `temperature` - controls how much of the probability distribution the model will use when it is generating each token. 1.0 means that it samples from the complete probability distrubiton, 0.7 means that it drops the bottom 30% of the least likely tokens when it is sampling. 0.0 means that it will perform deterministically and always output the single most probable token for each context. \n",
        " * `top_p` - is an alternative way of controling the sampling. \n",
        " * `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` are two ways of reduing the model from repeating the same words in one output.  You can set these to be >0 if you're seeing a lot of repetition in your output. \n",
        " * `max_tokens` is the maximum length in tokens that will be output by calling the function.  A token is a subword unit.  There are roughly 2 or 3 tokens per word on average.\n",
        " * `stop` is a list of stop sequences.  The model will stop generating output once it generates one of these strings, even if it hasn't reached the max token length. By default this is set to a special token `<|endoftext|>`.\n",
