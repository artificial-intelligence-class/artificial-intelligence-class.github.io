Born in Arinsal, Torres was the daughter of Lloren\u00e7 Torres, a local baker. Torres's later life was marked by tragedy; her mother died in 1864, and in 1867 both her sister and father were killed in an accident. Torres spent most of her youth in the home of her aunt and uncle. She studied the Andorran language with the Catalan linguist Francesc de Borja Moll, and in 1884 she published her first work, a grammar of the language. At the age of 25, Torres became the first woman in Andorra to teach. She later moved to Barcelona, where she studied philosophy. In 1889, she published Philosophy and Letters, a textbook on philosophy that was widely used in Catalan schools. Torres returned to Andorra in 1891, and the following year she became the director of the Andorran Franciscan Sisters. Torres died in Andorra on 29 December 1973 at the age of 101."
